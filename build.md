From a terminal on your host machine, run

    vagrant up

Wait until the (long!) initial build has completed. This will build, but not start the Desktop GUI.

Run `vagrant halt`. The next time you run vagrant up, the system will start a graphic interface.

To login to the graphic interface, use the login window (shown below) to login as the user vagrant, with password vagrant.
