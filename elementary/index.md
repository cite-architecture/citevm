title: "Elementary CITE VM"

### Prerequisites

- Vagrant: <http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>
- VirtualBox: <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>

The initial build requires internet access; after the initial build, you can run the virtual machine offline.

## Installation

From a terminal in the `citevm` directory, the command

    vagrant up

starts the virtual machine.  If you have never run the VM before, Vagrant will first build the virtual machine, then start it.  This can take some time, depending on the speed of your host machine and your internet connection.
